#### Phase 4d: Preset Custom Naming ❌ **NOT STARTED**
- [ ] Custom naming for presets (similar pattern to project naming)
- [ ] Store in `.preset-metadata.json`, display as "Preset01 - My Custom Name"

### Phase 5: Automated Testing 🚧 **IN PROGRESS - HIGH PRIORITY**

Implement automated testing to catch bugs early and enable confident refactoring. Recent rename synchronization issues highlighted the need for comprehensive test coverage.

**Current Status**: 217 tests passing across 13 test files (54 infrastructure/utility + 29 IPC handler + 11 App + 23 SampleInfo + 8 integration tests + 18 PDF export + 13 WelcomeScreen + 21 ImportDialog + 46 sampleNumbering)

#### Phase 5a-d: Test Infrastructure & Core Testing ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] Vitest + React Testing Library setup with memfs for IPC mocking
- [x] Utility function tests (fileConflictResolver, constants, App helpers) - 54 tests
- [x] IPC handler tests (rename, delete operations with security validation) - 29 tests
- [x] Component refactoring: Split AudioPlayer into AudioWaveform, SampleInfo, SampleTechnicalDetails, SampleView
- [x] SampleInfo component tests (rename, description, validation, error handling) - 23 tests

### Phase 6: Project Overview ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] Interactive tree view with clickable Multigrain/Projects nodes for overview
- [x] Storage usage statistics, unified selection architecture with type-safe state

### Phase 7: Reference Sheet Export ✅ **FUNCTIONAL - LAYOUT IMPROVEMENTS PENDING**

Generate printable PDF reference sheets to help users remember which projects are which and which samples are used where.

**Two Types of Reference Sheets**:

1. **Overview Sheet** - General SD card overview
   - [x] List all projects with bank/position mapping (e.g., "X / 1 - Project Name")
   - [x] Show custom names if set
   - [x] Display sample/preset counts per project
   - [ ] Layout improvements (optimize spacing, table formatting)

2. **Project Sheets** - Detailed per-project reference
   - [x] List available samples in the project
   - [x] Show which presets use which samples (including Autosave)
   - [x] Include user descriptions for samples
   - [x] Display sample location badges (PROJECT/WAVS/RECS)
   - [x] Exclude technical details (sample rate, bit depth, file sizes)
   - [ ] Layout improvements (optimize spacing, better formatting)

**Implementation Status**:
- [x] Install PDFKit dependency (`pdfkit`, `@types/pdfkit`)
- [x] Create data aggregation utilities (overview data, project data with preset-to-sample mapping)
- [x] Build PDF generator with compact layouts (overview table, samples list, presets with 8 sample slots)
- [x] Add IPC handlers for three export types (overview, single project, batch all projects)
- [x] Create React hook for export operations with loading states
- [x] Add context menu items: "Export Overview Sheet", "Export Project Sheet", "Export All Project Sheets"
- [x] Implement file name sanitization for special characters
- [x] Build reverse mapping: sample → presets that use it (for "Used by" lists)
- [x] PDFs open in system browser (cross-platform)
- [x] Shared preset parser utility to eliminate code duplication
- [x] Empty preset slot filtering (bug fix)
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage (18 new tests)
- [ ] Test cross-platform PDF generation (Windows tested, macOS/Linux pending)

**Files Created**:
1. ✅ `src/main/ipc/pdfExport.ts` - IPC handlers for PDF export operations
2. ✅ `src/main/utils/pdfGenerator.ts` - Core PDF generation logic using PDFKit
3. ✅ `src/main/utils/pdfLayouts.ts` - Layout constants (page dimensions, fonts, colors)
4. ✅ `src/main/utils/exportDataAggregator.ts` - Data preparation and sample resolution
5. ✅ `src/main/utils/presetParser.ts` - Shared preset file parsing utility
6. ✅ `src/renderer/hooks/usePdfExport.ts` - React hook for export UI integration
7. ✅ `src/main/utils/presetParser.test.ts` - Preset parser tests (8 tests)
8. ✅ `src/main/utils/exportDataAggregator.test.ts` - Data aggregator tests (10 tests)

**Files Modified**:
1. ✅ `src/main/ipc/index.ts` - Register PDF export handlers
2. ✅ `src/main/preload.ts` - Expose PDF export API to renderer
3. ✅ `src/shared/types.ts` - Add `OverviewData` and `ProjectExportData` interfaces
4. ✅ `src/renderer/components/FileTree.tsx` - Add context menu items for export
5. ✅ `package.json` - Add pdfkit dependency
6. ✅ `src/main/ipc/preset.ts` - Use shared preset parser
7. ✅ `src/main/index.ts` - Add development menu with reload shortcuts

**Status**: Core functionality implemented and tested. PDFs generate correctly with accurate data. Layout refinements needed for better print presentation. System browser preview works reliably across platforms.

**Key Bug Fixes**:
- ✅ Fixed "Not used in any presets" issue by creating shared preset parser
- ✅ Filter empty preset slots in sample usage mapping
- ✅ Correct bank naming (X, Y, Z, XX, YY, ZZ)

**Design Decisions**:
- PDFKit over Puppeteer (smaller, no Chromium dependency)
- Main process over renderer (better file system access, no IPC overhead for large data)
- Context menus as primary trigger (consistent with existing UI patterns)
- System browser for preview (more reliable than Electron's PDF viewer)
- Batch export to folder (more efficient than individual file dialogs)

### Phase 8: Polish & User Experience ❌ **NOT STARTED**

#### Phase 8a: Tree Navigation Controls
- [ ] **Collapse All button** in tree view header
  - Add button next to file tree title/path display
  - Collapse all expanded projects and folders

- [ ] Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] UI/UX refinements and accessibility improvements
- [ ] Performance optimization for large sample libraries
- [ ] User documentation and help system
- [ ] CreateProjectDialog should submit on Enter key
- [ ] Comprehensive error messages and user guidance
- [ ] Edge case handling (corrupted files, permissions issues)

**Status**: Basic error handling exists. Comprehensive testing and polish phase pending.

### Phase 9: Distribution & Deployment 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**

#### Phase 9a: CI/CD Testing Pipeline ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- [x] Run on push and pull requests to main branch
- [x] Type checking with TypeScript (tsc --noEmit)
- [x] Code linting with ESLint (strict mode, --max-warnings 0)
- [x] Test suite execution (217 tests)
- [x] Test results artifact upload
- [x] Status badge in README

**Test Workflow** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`):
- Runs on ubuntu-latest with Node.js 20
- Executes: `npm ci → type-check → lint → test`
- Badge: `![Tests](https://github.com/gloeglm/multigrain-ui/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)`
- Current: 168 tests, 0 TypeScript errors, 0 ESLint warnings

#### Phase 9b: Code Quality & Linting ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] ESLint 9 with flat config (eslint.config.js)
- [x] TypeScript ESLint plugin with recommended rules
- [x] React and React Hooks linting
- [x] Prettier integration for code formatting
- [x] Strict linting: --max-warnings 0 (zero tolerance)
- [x] Separate rules for test files (relaxed any types)
- [x] Scripts: lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, type-check
- [x] All 150 tests pass, zero linting warnings, zero type errors

**Linting Configuration**:
- ESLint 9 flat config with TypeScript, React, Prettier plugins
- Prettier for consistent formatting (single quotes, 100 char width, semicolons)
- Test files allow `any` types for mocking flexibility
- React hooks exhaustive-deps disabled where intentional

#### Phase 9c: Build & Release Automation ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] Multi-platform builds (Windows, macOS, Linux) on native runners
- [x] Publish to GitHub Releases with version tagging
- [x] Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- [x] Two beta releases published (v0.1.0-beta.1, v0.1.0-beta.2)
- [ ] Code signing setup (future)
  - [ ] macOS: Apple Developer ID signing + notarization
  - [ ] Windows: Code signing certificate
- [ ] Auto-update mechanism (future)

**Status**: Full CI/CD pipeline operational. Multi-platform builds and GitHub Releases working. Code signing deferred to future release.

**Implementation Approach**:
- **GitHub Actions**: Trigger on version tags (`v*.*.*`)
- **Matrix Build Strategy**: Parallel builds on ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest
- **Electron Forge GitHub Publisher**: Automatically upload artifacts to GitHub Releases
- **Draft Releases**: Allow review before making public
- **Auto-generated Release Notes**: Use GitHub's release notes generation from commit history
- **No Code Signing Initially**: Structure workflow to add signing later when certificates obtained

**Files to Create**:
1. `.github/workflows/release.yml` - CI/CD workflow configuration
2. `RELEASING.md` - Release process documentation

**Files to Modify**:
1. `forge.config.js` - Add `publishers` array with GitHub publisher config
2. `package.json` - Add `@electron-forge/publisher-github` dev dependency

**Release Process**:
```bash
npm version patch  # or minor/major
git push origin main --follow-tags
```
GitHub Actions will build installers and create a draft release for review.

### Phase 10: Nice to Have Features ❌ **NOT STARTED**

Optional enhancements that improve user experience but are not essential for core functionality. Users can work around these limitations manually.

- [ ] **Export samples to local file system**
  - Export individual samples to computer
  - Batch export multiple samples at once
  - Export entire project folder contents
  - Export all recordings from Recs folder
  - Select destination folder via native dialog
  - Progress indicator for batch exports
  - Option to preserve or flatten folder structure
  - **Use Case**: Especially useful for backing up recordings made on the hardware to the computer. Users can currently access files via SD card reader or Finder/Explorer.
- [ ] **Move/Copy samples between folders**
  - Move samples between Projects, Wavs, and Recs folders
  - Copy samples to create duplicates
  - Drag-and-drop to move samples
  - Conflict detection and resolution
  - Update preset references when moving samples (advanced)
  - **Rationale**: Users can achieve the same result by deleting samples and re-importing them to the desired location.
- [x] **Sample ordering & smart numbering** ✅ **COMPLETE** → See [detailed plan](./sample-numbering-plan.md)
  - [x] Optional number prefix during import (e.g., 01_kick.wav)
  - [x] Auto-detect existing numbering scheme and continue sequence
  - [x] Support for multiple separator styles (_, space, -, " - ", .)
  - [x] Drag-and-drop reordering in import dialog when numbering enabled
  - [x] Preview shows actual numbers that will be applied
  - [x] Persistent preference (localStorage)
  - [x] Context menu action to add prefixes to existing samples (Project, Wavs, Samples node)
  - [x] Layout improvements: compact conversion warnings onto one line in import dialog
  - **Status**: Complete.
- [ ] **Loudness normalization during import**
  - Optional loudness normalization to ensure consistent levels across samples
  - Target loudness standard (e.g., -14 LUFS or peak normalization to -1dB)
  - FFmpeg already available for audio processing
  - Toggle in import dialog with persistent preference
  - Preview/indicator showing which files will be adjusted
  - Consider offering different normalization modes (peak, RMS, LUFS)
  - **Rationale**: Samples from different sources often have varying loudness levels, making it harder to balance in presets. Normalization ensures a consistent starting point.
- [ ] **Detailed storage limits tracking** (e.g., "48/128 samples in PROJECT folder")
  - Show current vs. maximum sample counts per location
  - Visual progress bars or indicators
  - Warning when approaching limits
- [ ] **Action visibility in right panel**
  - Show "Create New Project" button on overview page
  - Show "Import Samples" / "Rename" buttons when project selected
  - Duplicate key context menu actions as buttons for better discoverability
- [ ] **Advanced search and filtering**
  - Search samples by name or description
  - Filter by sample location (PROJECT/WAVS/RECS)
  - Filter presets that use specific samples
- [ ] **Sample waveform thumbnails in lists**
  - Compact waveform previews in file tree
  - Visual identification of samples
- [ ] **Drag-and-drop file import**
  - Drop files directly onto project/folder nodes
  - Visual feedback during drag operations
- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts**
  - Common operations (import, export, create project)
  - Navigation shortcuts
- [ ] **Dark mode theme**
  - Alternative color scheme
  - Respect system preferences

**Status**: Collection of polish features to enhance usability. Implement as time/resources allow.
